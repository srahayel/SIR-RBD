# SIR-RBD

Regional brain measurements of iRBD patients used for running the agent-based Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model.

_RBDDBM.mat_, _RBDthickness.mat_, and _RBDarea.mat_ contain the average age-, sex-, and site-corrected W-scores (based on age- and sex-matched healthy controls recruited in each centre) for deformation-based morphometry-derived tissue deformation, surface-based derived cortical thickness, and cortical surface area observed in iRBD patients, respectively (see the Methods section of the paper for the processing details).

_RBDregion.mat_ contains the list of the corresponding cortical and subcortical brain regions.
